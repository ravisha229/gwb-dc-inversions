    "- To choose a good *dx* value, think about the minimum electrode spacing. The value of *dx* should be 25%-40% as large as the minimum electrode spacing. So if minimum electrode spacing is 10 m, you should choose a *dx* between 2.5 m and 4 m.\n",

    "- It is common to let *dz* be the same as *dx*. Sometimes we set *dz* to be half the size of *dx*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *corezlength* defines a depth limit for where you think most currents are. Below this depth, you are assuming the currents are very small. A good first guess would be to set *corezlength* to be equal to the maximum AB electrode spacing.\n",

For a dipole-dipole survey, set the padding region to be 2-3 times larger than the maximum AB spacing"
