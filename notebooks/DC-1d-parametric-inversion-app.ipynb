    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we load DC sounding data (VES format), interpret the data and invert the data to recover a 1D resistivity model. The steps for setting up and running and inversion and explained. In this notebook, we specify the number of layers responsible for the data values. The inversion will adjust the thickness and resistivity of these layers when recovering a resistivity model. The final result of the notebook is a 1D resistivity model that has approximately the same structures as the true geology.\n",
